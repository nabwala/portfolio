Hi! 
I know noone is ever going to read this which makes it perfect for what I'm about to say but it's a likkle Easter egg for me to find a few years down the line. 
I coded this simple website over a span of two weeks as I tried to re-acquaint myself with the coding skills I learnt back in 2023. It was really fun having a creative outlet because studying for my Certified Secretary exams has been so dull and boring. As of today, the 5th of August 2025, It's really as basic as it gets but I'm superduper hopeful that I won't give up on this website.
Also, I've just used placeholder images but hopefully I'll soon get clients at the studio whose pictures I can use. I've invested so much into that studio I'm not even ready to imagine failing. I believe that I have so much potential and being productive makes me feel like I'm not wasting away.
Anyways, I have zero expectations for the future because I don't want to limit myself but I'll be spending the next few years saying YES to any opportunity that comes my way and hopefully I'll end up travelling the world and being the successful,strong, brilliant woman I've always known I could be. Who knows? I might get back into tech, I might become a media powerhouse, I might even use my degree as kindling (lol) but one thing's for sure and I'm two times as certain, I'm made for greatness.
Look at me gushing over html,CSS and beginner javascript. Ya big baby.

K byeeeee

I love you loads!
